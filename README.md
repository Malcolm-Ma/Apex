# Apex

A Web Server to Support the Review of Academic Papers for Conferences or Universities

See more in [front end](https://github.com/Malcolm-Ma/FE-review-of-academic-paper) and [back end](https://github.com/Malcolm-Ma/BE-review-of-academic-paper) repo.

## Synchronization Strategy

[Dependabot](/.github/dependabot.yml) scans the front-end and back-end code repositories every business day, and once it detects an update, bot automatically synchronizes the code to this repository via [actions](https://github.com/Malcolm-Ma/Apex/edit/main/README.md).
